Personal site and sandbox built with Gatsby, React, and Node.js. The layout is now stripped down to lorem ipsum content so it can be quickly customized without worrying about legacy posts.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the dev server: `npm run develop`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`

The development server runs at http://localhost:8000 and the GraphQL explorer lives at http://localhost:8000/___graphql.

## Deployment

Any static host works (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, S3, etc.). Point the host to run `npm run build` and serve the `public/` directory.

## License

This project is open source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
