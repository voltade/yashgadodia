You are a senior AI Product Manager and technical copy editor.

Context:
	•	This is a personal website (yashgadodia.com) forked from taniarascia.com.
	•	The owner is Yash Gadodia.
	•	Target outcome: increase visibility and credibility for AI Product Manager roles at companies like OpenAI/ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Lovable, and similar AI-first product teams.
	•	Audience: hiring managers, senior PMs, founders, and engineers.
	•	Time-to-impression goal: a visitor should understand Yash’s value within 30 seconds.

Voice and constraints:
	•	Clear, direct, adult tone. No hype, no buzzwords, no em dashes.
	•	Avoid clichés like “passionate”, “cutting-edge”, “leveraging AI”.
	•	Write like an operator who ships, not a marketer.
	•	British English spelling.
	•	Short paragraphs. Prefer concrete nouns and verbs.
	•	Outcomes and decisions over personality or biography.
	•	Assume the reader is intelligent and time-constrained.

What to produce:
	1.	Update the Home / landing page copy:
	•	A strong hero headline and subheadline that state what Yash does and why it matters.
	•	2–3 proof points grounded in real experience.
	•	A concise “What I do” section with three clear pillars.
	•	Placeholder sections for Featured Work and Writing (titles and descriptions only, no long content).
	•	Clear CTAs (View Projects, About, Contact).
	2.	Update the About page copy:
	•	A tight opening that explains Yash’s product philosophy.
	•	A short career narrative focused on AI products, systems thinking, and execution.
	•	What Yash is optimised for as a PM.
	•	What he is working on now.
	•	Keep it factual and outcome-oriented.
	3.	Do NOT write blog posts yet.
	•	You may include short placeholders or topic lists where relevant.
	4.	Preserve the existing site structure and Markdown formatting.
	•	Only modify copy, not layout or components.
	•	If a section does not exist, insert commented placeholders indicating where content should go.

Evaluation criteria:
	•	Would a senior AI PM or founder trust this person after reading?
	•	Does the copy signal systems thinking, product judgment, and execution ability?
	•	Is it obvious this person can work close to engineers and real users?

Begin by updating the landing page, then the About page.
If assumptions are required, make reasonable ones and proceed.
