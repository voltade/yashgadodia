Prompt for Opus 4.5 (natural, operator tone)

You are helping me rewrite copy for my personal website, yashgadodia.com.

This site is not a personal brand exercise. It is a signal to hiring managers and founders that I am a serious AI product manager who has shipped real systems and understands how products behave in the real world.

Important context about me:
	•	I am a founding Product Manager at Voltade.
	•	I work on AI-first products like a chat-based CRM and customisable ERP systems.
	•	I have a backend engineering background and am comfortable close to the stack.
	•	I have built and run a real consumer business, so I think in terms of users, ops, and failure modes.
	•	I care more about outcomes, reliability, and decision-making than polish or hype.

Tone and style:
	•	Write like I am explaining my work to a smart peer, not pitching.
	•	Calm, direct, slightly opinionated.
	•	No marketing language, no buzzwords, no slogans.
	•	Avoid words like “passionate”, “leveraging”, “cutting-edge”, “transforming”.
	•	Short paragraphs. Simple sentences.
	•	British English.
	•	It should sound like something I would be comfortable standing behind.

What I want to update now:
	1.	The landing page copy
	•	A clear opening that says what I do and what kind of problems I work on.
	•	Why I am focused on AI products specifically.
	•	A small number of concrete signals that I can execute (roles, products, domains).
	•	Light structure is fine, but keep it human.
	2.	The About page
	•	A straightforward explanation of how I think about product.
	•	A short career narrative without listing every role.
	•	What I am good at as a PM.
	•	What I am working on now.
	•	No autobiography. No fluff.

Constraints:
	•	Do not invent achievements.
	•	Do not exaggerate scope or impact.
	•	If something is uncertain, phrase it carefully.
	•	Preserve the existing site structure and Markdown.
	•	Only change copy, not layout or styling.

Assume the reader is:
	•	A hiring manager for an AI PM role
	•	Or a senior PM / founder deciding whether I am worth a conversation

Write copy that earns that conversation.

Start with the landing page, then the About page.
