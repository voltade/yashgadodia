Website copy + structure guide (natural, operator tone)

You are helping me rewrite copy for my personal website, yashgadodia.com.

This site should feel authentic and simple (more like taniarascia.com than a “personal brand” landing page). It should read like a capable builder writing to peers: clear, calm, and specific.

Important context about me:
	•	I am a founding Product Manager at Voltade.
	•	I work on products and operational systems (including AI-enabled workflows) like a CRM and customisable ERP systems.
	•	I have a backend engineering background and am comfortable close to the stack.
	•	I have built and run a real consumer business, so I think in terms of users, ops, and failure modes.
	•	I care more about outcomes, reliability, and decision-making than polish or hype.

Tone and style:
	•	Write like I am explaining my work to a smart peer, not pitching.
	•	Calm, direct, slightly opinionated.
	•	No marketing language, no buzzwords, no slogans.
	•	Avoid words like “passionate”, “leveraging”, “cutting-edge”, “transforming”.
	•	Short paragraphs. Simple sentences.
	•	British English.
	•	It should sound like something I would be comfortable standing behind.
	•	Do not over-emphasise “AI PM” as an identity; mention AI only when it’s relevant to the work.

What I want to update now:
	1.	Homepage (layout + copy)
	•	Keep it simple: brief intro, clear links (“Start here”), then writing + selected projects.
	•	Avoid “pillars” / overly structured “How I Work” content; keep it human.
	•	Placeholders are OK if I haven’t provided details yet.
	2.	Projects
	•	Projects should look like a simple grid/list (Tania-style): date, name, one-line description, and links.
	•	Keep descriptions similar length (one line-ish).
	•	Do not add “Still live” to every project.
	•	If a project has a codebase, link it (e.g. AfterClass source).
	3.	About page
	•	A straightforward explanation of how I think about product.
	•	A short career narrative without listing every role.
	•	What I’m good at (in practice).
	•	What I’m working on now.
	•	No autobiography. No fluff.

Constraints:
	•	Do not invent achievements.
	•	Do not exaggerate scope or impact.
	•	If something is uncertain, phrase it carefully.
	•	Preserve the existing site style; favour minimal, obvious structure changes over heavy redesigns.
	•	When changing layout, keep it consistent with existing components/styles.

Assume the reader is:
	•	A hiring manager for product roles
	•	Or a senior PM / founder deciding whether I am worth a conversation

Write copy that earns that conversation.

Practical site rules:
	•	Primary email is: pirsquare.yash@gmail.com (use for all mailto/contact references).
	•	Do not link my GitHub profile (it’s not maintained). Prefer LinkedIn and/or lovable.dev (or placeholders I can swap later).
	•	Projects data lives in src/data/projectsList.js — keep fields consistent and simple.
	•	If adding project screenshots, use static assets committed under static/projects/ and reference via a stable path (no hotlinking).
