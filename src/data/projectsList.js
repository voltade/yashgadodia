		description: `Founding PM at Voltade, building AI-first products for SMEs.

I currently lead product direction and execution for:
• Envoy, a chat-based AI CRM focused on sales and support workflows
• Digital Brain, a highly customisable ERP foundation designed for high-variance SME operations

My work spans user discovery, workflow mapping, product definition, and close collaboration with engineers on data models, integrations, and system behaviour. A large part of the role involves turning ambiguous operational problems into shippable product bets, then instrumenting them to see whether they actually work.

A recurring constraint across projects is data migration, volume, and operational correctness. Product decisions are often driven by what will hold up once customers depend on the system daily.`,

		description: `Worked on internal platforms and core infrastructure at Ninja Van, supporting logistics operations at large scale across Southeast Asia.

Key projects included leading backend development for Ninja Easy, a one-off parcel delivery service built from zero to one. The service reached 13,000 orders within five months, and a subsequent V2 iteration drove an 80% increase in user growth. This required close coordination across four teams and careful attention to operational edge cases.

Built and launched an internal ChatOps incident response tool, similar to PagerDuty but embedded in Google Chat. The system supported 2,000+ daily active engineers and has handled 35,000+ incidents since launch.

Worked extensively on the company's Notifications Services, maintaining systems responsible for SMS, email, push, and SNS delivery, processing 100 million+ Kafka events per day. Led optimisation efforts that resulted in six-figure cost savings. Also architected and launched Ninja Van's first voice calling microservice, handling 3 million callouts in five months.

These projects shaped how I think about reliability, failure modes, and the cost of poor abstractions in production systems.`,

		description: `Co-founded AfterClass, a student-built platform serving university communities in Singapore.

Led a team of five to design and build a one-stop portal for module reviews, second-hand textbook listings, and internship postings. The platform reached 10,000 registered users and 4.5 million page views within three months, and was accepted into the SMU IIE Student Entrepreneur Internship Programme.

The application remains in production and is used daily by 50,000 students across the top three universities in Singapore.

This was an early end-to-end product experience, from identifying real user needs to shipping, scaling, and maintaining a live system with limited resources.`,

		description: `Founded and operate The Bon Pet, a direct-to-consumer pet food business.

This is a real operating business with production, supply chain, compliance, customer support, and retention constraints. Running it has influenced how I think about product far more than hypothetical projects. Decisions have immediate consequences, and trade-offs between quality, cost, and reliability are unavoidable.

The experience keeps my product thinking grounded in user trust, operational reality, and long-term sustainability rather than surface-level metrics.`,
